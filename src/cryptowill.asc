/u/Sirpeech's guide for your non-crypto loved ones to recover you funds in case
of emergency or catastrophe. Placed on github to be used as needed.

== Introduction == 

Since most of my family members aren't too good with technology, I've decided
to type this out for them and include in my safe deposit box in case something
ever happens to me. Otherwise, my cryptocurrencies (majority of my net worth
now) would be gone forever. Feel free to make any changes/improvements. The
parts I've left blank (besides Ethereum and Ripple addresses) are meant to be
hand written for additional safety. The provided ethereum address is mine in
case anyone finds this very useful and would like to tip a small amount.

== How to recover my crypto holdings from Ledger Nano S (Black stick) ==

The easiest way to access my cryptocurrencies is to find someone knowledgeable
with computers and make sure they are honest and they will guide you through.
Just tell them my cryptocurrency is on a Ledger Nano S and have them look up
how to use it online and how to trade cryptocurrencies into cash via exchanges
such as Gemini or Coinbase and Poloniex. Try everything with small amounts
first until you get the hang of it and make the big transfers. Even if it takes
over a week, trust me, it is worth your time.

The harder way will be to follow the instructions below.

Create an account for yourself at Gemini.com (to convert Ethereum to cash) and
link a bank account. This may take a few days. If you hover over Transfer Funds
> Deposit Into Exchange > ETH you can see your Gemini deposit address.

=== Using Ledger Nano S ===

. Download the following apps for Google Chrome off Ledger Nano S website. Just
search Google for the following and click on them (usually first link) and
install.

.. Ledger Manager

.. Ledger Wallet Ripple

.. Ledger Wallet Ethereum

. Look at YouTube videos on how to use Ledger Nano S

. Go to Shapeshift.io (website)

. Under Deposit select Ripple and under Receive select Ether. Select Quick, it
is easier.

. Enter the Deposit Addresses of the Ledger Nano S wallets:

.. Ethereum Address: 0xc0440a97c49E2a59F93cDC7D049EDe935C3ada9E

.. Ripple Address:

.. Note: Always copy/paste codes to be safe, dont type them out

. Click that you agree to the terms and start transaction

. Connect Ledger Nano S via USB cable to laptop. If it is not the black USB
cable with the Ledger icon at the small side of the end it might not recognize
the device.

. The PIN for my Ledger Nano S is: xxxxxx

. If you enter the PIN incorrectly more than three times you might have to go
through a recovery process using the 24 seed word list.

. Open Ledger Wallet Ripple app

. Ledger Wallet Ripple app will indicate balance. Toward the top there is a
Home icon and Up and Down arrows. Click the Up arrow to send.

. Enter a small amount (~100) of Ripple to send to make sure it is working

. Enter the destination tag from the shapeshift.io transaction (the format will
be something like rwfGzgd4bUStS9gA5xUhCmg1J86TMtmHMo) into Recipient Address on
Ripple Ledger Wallet

. On bottom left of Ledger Wallet Ripple app click Advanced Mode

. On shapeshift.io it will say something below destination tag in the format:
dt=10016391

. Copy the number after the dt= (i.e. 10016391) and paste it into TAG on Ledger
Wallet Ripple

. Click send and confirm transaction on Ledger Nano S.

. The transaction should take less than 10 minutes (usually a lot faster)

. Repeat to convert all Ripple to Ethereum

. Open Ledger Wallet Ethereum app and click ETH

. Ledger Wallet Ethereum app will indicate balance. Toward the top there is a
Home icon and Up and Down arrows. Click the Up arrow to send.

. Enter a small amount (~3) of Ethereum to send to make sure it is working

. Send to the Deposit address found in your Gemini account.

. The transaction should take less than an hour (usually a lot faster)

. Transfer as much as needed and close Ledger Wallet Ethereum app

. Convert the ETH to USD on Gemini by selling ETH and withdraw into bank
account.

=== Poloniex ===

I have other cryptocurrencies stored on Poloniex.com Use the following
instructions to recover those.

. Go to poloniex.com

. Click Sign in at top right

.. Email: xxx

.. Password: xxx

.. Open my iPhone with passcode: xxx

.. Go to Finance folder and click Authenticator app

.. The bottom number is what you need to enter on poloniex.com (time-sensitive)

.. If you are unable to use my phone for logging in, you must contact poloniex
and tell them my two factor authentication recovery code is: xxx

. Go to the top right and hover over Balance.

. Click Deposits and Withdrawals.

. Here you can see all the other cryptocurrencies I have.

. Click Exchange in the top left

. At Markets on the right, click BTC right below it then click one of the coins
I had in Deposits and Withdrawals.

. For example click DGB

. Below the chart it says Sell DGB

. Below that it says Buy orders

. If you want to sell immediately, you change the SELL price to be lower than
the buy orders. Alternatively, you click one of the buy orders that shows
SUM(BTC) amount that you want to sell, you will sell at the top amounts until
that amount.

. Type in amount of DGB you want to sell or click the number next to You Have

. If you take up all the buy orders for that price, the remaining amount is
placed as an order for you but you can always cancel later. It says order
placed.

. Click Sell.

. Repeat until all coins have been converted to BTC.

. Now under BTC find ETH and click on it.

. Repeat the same procedure except buy ETH instead of selling.

. If you did everything correctly, when you go to Balances then Deposits &
Withdrawals, the only remaining coin should be ETH.

. For ETH click withdraw and send to your Gemini address. You can only send up
to $7,000 worth of coins per day from poloniex.

. You will need to verify the withdrawal using the Authenticator app on my
phone and by clicking a confirmation link in my email.
